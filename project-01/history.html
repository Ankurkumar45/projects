		<h1>Men's Cricket</h1>
		<p>The first game of cricket was played in India by European sailors, who played the sport as a recreational activity in the first half of the 18th century. These sailors played cricket near their coastal settlements. The first recorded match in India was played between the British army and British settlers in 1751. The world's second-oldest cricket club, Calcutta Cricket Club, was founded in 1792 in present-day Kolkata. The Parsis were the first civilian community to accept cricket as a sport and play it in India.In 1848, they set up the Oriental Cricket Club in present-day Mumbai. In 1850, they founded the Young Zoroastrian Cricket Club. In 1886, the Hindu Gymkhana sports club was founded</p>
		<p>In 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, and were sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor of the current International Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team that was led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes, to India.</p>
		
		<h2>Founding and early years</h2>
		<p>In a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in the ICC if all of the game's promoters in the country united to establish a single controlling body. An assurance was given and on 21 November 1927 a meeting was held in Delhi, which was attended by delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar, Central Provinces and Berar, Sindh and Punjab. The delegates agreed to create a board for control of cricket in India. On 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken, and the BCCI was formed in December 1928. R. E. Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello was secretary.</p>
		<p>In 1926, the BCCI joined the Imperial Cricket Council, then the governing body for international cricket. In 1936, the BCCI started India's premier first-class cricket championship the Ranji Trophy, which was named after the first Indian person who played international cricket, the King of Nawanagar state K.S. Ranjitsinhji, who played for England in international cricket. The Mumbai cricket team is the most-successful team, winning 41 titles.</p>
		<p>In 1932, India played its maiden Test match under the captaincy of CK Naidu against England at Lord's cricket ground in London. During England's 1933-34 tour of India, on 17 December 1933, Lala Amarnath became the first Indian batsman to score a test century, scoring 118 on his debut, at Bombay Gymkhana. In 1967–68, India won its first-ever Test cricket series outside Asia. Previously it had defeated Pakistan, New Zealand and England, and won series in India.</p>

		<p>
             Through the 1980s and early 1990s, BCCI paid ₹5 lakh per match to terrestrial television network Doordarshan to broadcast the Indian cricket team's matches.
              It hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup competitions in 1987 and 1996.
              In 1991, BCCI proposed South Africa's readmission to international cricket at the International Cricket Council (ICC). After the proposal succeeded, the BCCI sold television broadcast rights for the first time; South African Broadcasting Corporation purchased the rights to broadcast the South African cricket tour of India, South Africa's first official international tour after the 21-year boycott from international cricket. During this time, South Africa joined the "Asian bloc" of the BCCI and its South-Asian neighbours.

        <h3>21st century</h3>
        <p>In 2007, the BCCI established the Indian Premier League (IPL), an annual, franchise-based, Twenty20 cricket league.

Due to the IPL's commercial success, similarly styled Twenty20 leagues appeared around the world, as did franchise-based leagues in other sports in India.</p>
        <p>In 2019, the BCCI recognised retired players' union the Indian Cricketers Association (ICA), which was formed after the Lodha committee's recommendation to form a indipendent organisation for welfare of nation's players.

		<h3>Controversies</h3>
		<p>From 2008, the BCCI banned Pakistani players from playing in the IPL due to Pakistan's involvement in 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks,in which terrorist attack by Pakistan-trained terrorists killed 166 people died and injured 238. The attacks angered Indians. In 2012, the BCCI advised its IPL franchises not to buy any Pakistani players. It was wary of several issues; their off-field misdemeanours and spot-fixing allegations against them.</p>
		<p>From 2012, BCCI opposed holding any bilateral series with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). India plays against Pakistan only in ICC and ACC multinational events. Many times, the PCB urged BCCI to play bilateral series but BCCI rejected them. According to the BCCI, India cannot not play bilateral series against Pakistan without the Government of India's permission. According to the Indian government, Pakistan sponsors, harbours and supports terrorist organisations, and trains terrorists. In 2017, the Sports Minister of India, Vijay Goel said Pakistan should first stop sponsoring terrorists.</p>
		<p>BCCI pays 10 percent from the salary of every foreign player to their respective national board. In 2022, the Australian Cricketers' Association expressed their unhappiness about these payments.</p>
